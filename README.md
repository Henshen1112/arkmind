## Data Collection & Processing
Start by loading the dataset and performing an initial exploration. Check the shape of the dataset, view the first few rows, obtain information about the columns, and check for missing values.

## Data Visualization
Visualize the relationships between different variables in the dataset using heatmaps. These visualizations can provide insights into the distribution of data and the relationships between variables.

## Label Encoding
Convert categorical variables into numerical format using label encoding.

## Model Training
Implements multiple machine learning models for classification tasks, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, or others. These models is train on the training set.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained models on the testing set using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing and can help in comparing different models.

## Final Model Selection
The KNeighborsClassifier seems to perform the best among the models tested, achieving the highest accuracy score, precision score, and F1 score.
